Siri Lite!<br/>
This application uses a Binary Search Tree to find a response to a user input based on keywords entered.<br/>
#####
After a string is entered, the program will search for a predefined phrase that best is the best response to the input.<br/>
The user can then respond with whether or not the response was useful, to more accurately choose responses thereafter.
